# TO-DO List

Things that I want to still add to vim, to make it feel like vscode, so that I can make the transition.

- Find and replace text with a keymap
- Something that can run vscode tasks? Or run tasks like vscode
- Can I debug through vim?
- Show just one diagnostic per line (virtual text). Sometimes it overlaps and I can't see at least one. 
- In git status, how to stage/unstage just a section of the file
