# TO-DO List

Things that I want to still add to vim, to make it feel like vscode, so that I can make the transition.

- Find and replace text with a keymap
- Rename var/fn/wtv through all files
- Something that can run vscode tasks? Or run tasks like vscode
- Can I debug through vim?
- Show just one diagnostic per line (virtual text). Sometimes it overlaps and I can't see at least one. 
- In git status, how to stage/unstage just a section of the file
- Add vim-fubitive and vim-rhubarb to search repo files in the browser
- Look into plugins that help refactoring
- Look into which-key.nvim
- Look into lualine.nvim (statusline plugin)
- Test moving lines in visual mode, with Alt key (option in mac isn't working dunno why)
- How does merging work? (Check ThePrimeagen's video about git)
- What is coc-lists
- Diagnostics stays on top of code
- Window/buffer? to show errors and the files in it
- How to show hint meun, like converting to something (it's the lightbuld in vscode)
- Show params of a function, like option + esc in vscode (mac)
- Formatting on keymap
- How to collapse and expand code blocks (html as well)
- Comment entire sections (like cmd + /)
- Enable ligatures
